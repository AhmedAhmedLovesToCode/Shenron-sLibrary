                            Earth is a central planet where most of the story takes place. It is home to Goku and his friends and features a mix of advanced technology and mystical elements, including Dragon Balls that summon Shenron. 
                            Earth has been attacked multiple times by powerful villains. Despite its vulnerability, Earth's defenders—the Z Fighters—consistently protect it. 
                            The planet has been destroyed and revived multiple times using the Dragon Balls. It is known for its diverse landscapes, including Capsule Corporation's futuristic cities, Kame House's remote island, and Kami's Lookout in the sky.

                            Earth is introduced as a place where martial artists and mystical beings coexist. Goku, Bulma, and their friends begin their adventures searching for the Dragon Balls, encountering threats like the Red Ribbon Army and King Piccolo, who briefly takes over Earth before being stopped.

                            Earth faces numerous threats from extraterrestrial invaders like Saiyans (Vegeta and Nappa), Frieza’s forces, 
                            the Androids, Cell, and Majin Buu. The Dragon Balls play a vital role in reviving Earth and its inhabitants after large-scale destruction. 
                            Despite its vulnerability, Earth is home to the powerful Z Fighters, who continually protect it.

                            Earth becomes even more significant as it hosts the Tournament of Power and serves as a battleground for divine beings like Beerus, Goku Black, and Moro. 
                            Thanks to Bulma’s advancements and the Saiyans' presence, Earth is increasingly recognized as an important planet in the multiverse.
                            Despite constant threats, Earth's survival is ensured by the Dragon Balls and its defenders, making it a central and resilient planet in the Dragon Ball universe.

                            Earth remains a focal point, with threats such as Baby taking over its population and later the invasion of the Shadow Dragons. 
                            The planet is ultimately destroyed in the finale but is restored with a wish to the Dragon Balls.

                        Planet Namek is a distant, green-hued planet that serves as the home of the Namekian race, including Piccolo’s ancestors and the creator of Earth’s Dragon Balls. 
                        It has a peaceful environment with vast oceans, blue grass, and three suns, resulting in constant daylight. Namek is most significant during the Frieza Saga, 
                        where Goku and his friends travel there to find the planet’s powerful Dragon Balls to revive their fallen allies.
                        However, Namek becomes a battleground when Frieza and his forces arrive, seeking immortality. The conflict leads to intense battles between the Z Fighters, Vegeta, 
                        Frieza’s army, and eventually Goku, who achieves Super Saiyan form for the first time. After Frieza triggers the planet’s destruction, Namek is ultimately obliterated, 
                        but its people are later relocated to New Namek with the help of the Dragon Balls.
                        New Namek appears briefly when Baby attacks the planet, forcing Goku and Uub to intervene. However, it plays a minor role compared to other planets in the series.

                            Otherworld is the afterlife in the Dragon Ball universe, where souls go after death. It is a vast spiritual realm overseen by King Yemma, who judges whether souls go to Heaven or Hell. 
                            Otherworld features various divine locations, including Snake Way, King Kai’s Planet, and the Grand Kai’s Planet, where powerful warriors train after death.

                            Goku first visits Otherworld after sacrificing himself against Raditz, traveling Snake Way to train under King Kai, where he learns the Kaio-Ken and Spirit Bomb.
                            After dying again in the Cell Saga, Goku participates in the Otherworld Tournament, facing warriors like Pikkon.
                            Hell houses villains such as Frieza, Cell, and the Ginyu Force, but souls can sometimes escape, as seen when Goku and Vegeta battle Janemba in Fusion Reborn.

                            Frieza is revived from Hell, where he was trapped in a personal torment filled with fairies and singing creatures.
                            The Supreme Kai Realm becomes more relevant, as deities like Beerus, Whis, and the Omni-King Zeno influence cosmic events.

                            Hell becomes more prominent when Dr. Gero and Dr. Myuu open a portal, allowing villains like Frieza and Cell to return, 
                            leading to Goku’s battle in Hell before he escapes.

                            In Dragon Ball Z, the Supreme Kai Planet is the home of the Supreme Kai (Shin) and Elder Kai. 
                            It is a divine, mystical world located in the higher realms of the universe. 
                            The planet has a serene and otherworldly atmosphere, with floating islands and unique, vast landscapes.

                            Introduced during the Majin Buu Saga, when Gohan is taken there by Shin (Supreme Kai) to unlock his potential through the Z Sword training.
                            After breaking the Z Sword, Elder Kai emerges and unlocks Gohan’s Ultimate form through a mystical ritual.
                            The planet is later the site of Kid Buu’s final battle against Goku and Vegeta, as it is one of the few places unaffected by Buu’s destruction of Earth.

                            The Supreme Kai Planet becomes more important, serving as a meeting place for Beerus, Whis, and the Supreme Kais.
                            It is a key location in training Future Trunks and discussing threats like Zamasu and Goku Black during the Future Trunks Saga.
                            The planet is where Shin and Elder Kai observe universal events, including the Tournament of Power.
