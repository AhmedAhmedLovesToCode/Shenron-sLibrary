a Meeting the Specifications
My Shenron's Library website meets the assignment specifications as follows:
Interactive Functionality:
jQuery UI: Integrated the jQuery UI accordion widget to organize Dragon Ball content in a collapsible format, aiding user experience.
jQuery Plugins: Added an intro plugin on the right-hand side to display personal information and an image.
AJAX Requests: Implemented a central button-triggered AJAX request that fetches information about the 7 Dragon Balls and shows it in a toggleable popup.
Conditional UI Display: A "Welcome to Shenronâ€™s Library" popup appears only once per session using sessionStorage logic.
Design & Usability Guidelines Followed:
Consistent layout separation with external HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
Responsive design using media queries.
Use of semantic HTML for accessibility and better structure.
Dragon Ball-themed visuals with stylized buttons, color palettes, and fonts.
Ensured text contrast and keyboard-navigable elements for accessibility.

b: Semester Progress and Learning Summary
Over the semester, I made significant progress through each assignment:
Assignment 1: Established the core layout with static HTML, learning proper structuring and content organization.
Assignment 2: Introduced CSS to style the site, using layout models like flexbox for positioning and visual consistency.
Assignment 3: Implemented jQuery UI components such as the accordion and began modularizing JavaScript for cleaner logic.
Assignment 4: Integrated AJAX functionality and session-based conditional popups. Gained experience with dynamic data rendering and DOM manipulation.
Key Learnings:
Mastered how to effectively separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Learned to use jQuery and plugins to add advanced interactivity.
Developed AJAX logic to fetch and display external content asynchronously.
Understood debugging and iterative refinement throughout the development process.

c: Stakeholder Satisfaction and Future Plans
How well the application meets stakeholder needs:
The design and layout cater to Dragon Ball enthusiasts, providing interactive and structured access to saga-related content.
The popup and accordion UI makes the site both engaging and user-friendly.
Personal introduction helps users connect with the creator and adds credibility.
Future Development Plans:
Expand AJAX capabilities to fetch data from Dragon Ball-related APIs.
Add search and filter tools for deeper content interaction.
Enhance mobile responsiveness and optimize load times.
Eventually convert the project into a React-based single-page application (SPA) for modern scalability and performance.
